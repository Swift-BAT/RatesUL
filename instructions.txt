(MC March 6, 2023) This document provides instructions re: how I calculated upper limits for the Swift/GBM paper.

1. Searching the for coincidental detection with the GW trigger.

To search for the overlapping region between the GW probability map and BAT's FoV, I run
transient_search.sh; e.g.
./transient_search.sh S190510g 2019-05-10T02:59:39.292 UTC 0.0 0.0 path/to/S190510g/bayestar.fits.gz path/to/S190510g/bayestar_convolved.fits.gz"

This is a script modified from ***Amy Lien's*** original code in https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.4567. I ran it on BAT machines
at Goddard---however, I only use this code to search for coincidental detections with the GW trigger and the extraction
of lightcurves. All the scripts that this code calls for are under the directory 'scripts'. Those are Amy Lien's work,
with minimal modifications from me.

The input for transient_search.sh is as follows:
"./transient_search.sh source_name T0 T0_type src_RA src_DEC input_img input_img_Phil"
source_name: the source name. This will be the folder name in the result directory
T0: enter either UTC or Swift MET
T0_type: enter the word "UTC" or "MET", depends on which T0 you entered.
src_RA: RA for an input source to be searched in the event data.
src_DEC: DEC for an input source to be searched in the event data
input_img: LIGO probability map. Enter "NONE" if unavailable.
input_ima_Phil: covolved LIGO map with nearby galaxies. Enter "NONE" if unavailable.


***This script relies on the data downloaded to the BAT machines. If to be done on another machine, you have to manually
put in the path to the relevant data and pointing files.***

When running transient_search.sh, a lockfile “transient_search_running” is created in the results directory.
If something goes wrong, you can check what's going on in there.

If run successfully, this script produces the raw lightcurves needed for the next step.
