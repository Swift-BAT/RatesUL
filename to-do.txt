In this repository so far:
- calc_BAT_ul.py: given a lightcurve, compute the flux upper limit assuming the Band model
- GettingFluxUpperLimits_fromBATrates.ipynb: notebook for the above
- Group_meetings.ipynb: our discussions from Monday Group_meetings

Milena needs to do the following (Nov 7):
- integrate the code for extraction of lightcurves & binning (currently done through Goddard machines)
- integrate plotting snippets of code
